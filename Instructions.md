And then you can place them where ever you want and do check that whether or not you can place all the queens.

As you can see, you can either **Reset** the board and play a fresh start or you can either go one step back with the **Backtrack**
option and finally, if you are not able to solve it on your own, you can ask the software to help by using the 
**Solve using Heuristic** option.
